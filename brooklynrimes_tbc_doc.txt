Creating a turn based combat 

Create object class --> " Character" 
    Create function to intialize values for Character class: 
        -Name of the character 
        -hitPoints(integer no max/min) = amount of damage can the character undergo 
        -hitChance(integer,0-100)= proability of a successful hit 
        -maxDamage(positive integer)= maximum amount of damage a single hit will undergo
        -armor(positive interger)= hits absorbed by armor

Create properties and setters for values
    -Setting functions --> create a way to insure integers are valid
    -This is done by testInt (test integer) function

testInt
    -takes values from Character class --> Tests them between a max and min 
    -not a legal value --> set to default 
    -default = 0
        1.Make sure value is in integer
        2.Then make sure integers are within parameter 
    return default 

Create a function to print out stats of character in play 

Create a function to determine if an attack will be hit by using value of the chance of the Character and enemy 
    - roll random number (1-100) 
    -if character's hitChance is greater than number rolled--> count as hit on given target
        -roll for damage of attack 
            -roll a number between 1 and  character's maxDamage (stored as variable-->"damage")
        -subtract target's armor rating from damage rolled 
            -(this determines the amount of damage dealt) 
        if: damage result < 0 --> set it to 0
            -(prevents negative numbers that helps the enemy)
        if: damage result > 0
            subtract damage from enemy's health

Create a function to run actual battle 
    -when you enter a new round of combat press enter until one of the character's health=0 
    -This is called basicFight
        -has parameters: character1 and character2
    -Create a keepGoing conditon to continue function until you reach "death"
    =While keepGoing:
        use "hit" funtion for characters
    -Print out status of each character 
    -If character hitPoints=0 
        -set keepGoing to false 
        -print winner's name 

Create a variable called start 
    -will ask for an input 
    -allows combat to pause in between round until user presses enter

Finally save enter code as tbc.py
